### **Postman Testing Workflow**

1. **Signup Users**
   - Use `/auth/signup` to create both **Professor** and **Student** accounts.

2. **Login Users**
   - Use `/auth/login` to retrieve tokens for both Professor and Student.

3. **Add Professor Availability**
   - Use `/availability` to add availability for the professor. Make sure to include the **Professor's JWT token**.

4. **View Professor Availability**
   - Use `/availability/:professorId` to fetch availability for the professor. Include the **Student's JWT token**.

5. **Book Appointment**
   - Use `/appointments` to book an appointment as a student. Provide the **Professor's ID** and the desired time.

6. **Check Appointments**
   - **For Students**: Use `/appointments/student` to view the student’s appointments.
   - **For Professors**: Use `/appointments/professor` to view the professor’s appointments.

7. **Cancel Appointment**
   - Use `/appointments/:appointmentId` to cancel an appointment as a professor.

8. **Update Appointment Status**
   - **For Professors**: Use `/appointments/:appointmentId/status` to mark an appointment as "confirmed."
   - **For Students**: Use `/appointments/:appointmentId/status` to mark the appointment as "completed" after attending.
